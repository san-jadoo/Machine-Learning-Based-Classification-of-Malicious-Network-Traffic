Machine-Learning-Based-Classification-of-Malicious-Network-Traffic

This project involves developing a machine learning model to classify network traffic as either benign or malicious 
using the CICIDS2017 dataset. The dataset, provided by the Canadian Institute for Cybersecurity, contains a 
comprehensive set of network traffic data that includes both normal and attack behaviors.
The Random Forest algorithm, known for its high accuracy and ability to handle large datasets, is used for building the classification 
model. The project encompasses data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, and evaluation to achieve 
a reliable and efficient network traffic classification system.
